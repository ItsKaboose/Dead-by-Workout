# Dead-by-Workout
A way to make Dead by Daylight compatible with Ring Fit controls! Using this will make you run to move in game, squat for Skill Checks, use your arms for actions in game, and MORE! 

If you are crazy enough to use this for Twitch, YouTube, etc. please give me some credit (just a simple link to this page, nothing super special unless you want to!)
If you find any bugs you can always let me know at https://twitter.com/ItsKaboose_ttv



### What is needed for this to work?

* For starters you will need the RingCon and the Legstrap as well
* A Titan Two Input converter (with the Wireless Expansion kit)
* A copy of Dead by Daylight
* Gtuner software: https://www.consoletuner.com/titan-two-downloads/

   -While you are there it would help to read up on how it all works to avoid headaches later on!




### Setting up the Mod

If you want to watch the video tutorial on how to set it up and how it works, head here: Video Tutorial soon!

If you want written step by step instructions here you go:

1. Connect your Titan Two to your PC via the PROG port
2. Open up the Gtuner software
3. Move the DeadbyWorkout.gpc file into the Memory slot of your choice
4. Make sure the Titan Two is set up to output as an Xbox 360 Controller
5. Swap the USB cable to the OUTPUT port of the Titan Two
6. Sync up the JoyCons with the Titan Two as follows:
    - Hold the left JoyCon vertical and hold down the sync button of both the Titan Two (the arrow on the right) and the JoyCon
    - Do the same for the right JoyCon (I found it works better syncing them left then right than the other way around)
    - If the lights on the JoyCons are in the top spot you are good to go, otherwise resync the JoyCons
    - Put the Right JoyCon onto the RingCon and the Left one into the Legstrap 
    - Put the Legstrap around your right leg as you'll be holding the RingCon to the left to be able to hit the buttons
7. Launch Dead by Daylight
8. Set up the Controls in game (see controls section below)
9. Load up the Tutorial to make sure its working correctly and get a feel for the gameplay (see "How to play" section below)
    - It helps to only having the Dead by Workout script running during gameplay, when waiting in lobbies and not moving your leg it can tend to "auto move" and force the cursor upwards. you can do this by hitting the up/down arrow on the Titan Two
    - Note the "Wiggle" section of the tutorial "wont work" thats just due to the tutorial not being updated to the new wiggle mechanic, it will work in matches!
10. Once you get used to the controls, you can hop into online (or custom) lobbies and start your new workout!


### Setting up the Controls 

   -Make sure the script is off or use an Xbox Controller when setting up the controls! 
   
   -It may not seem to make since for actual gameplay but the script will "correct" the controls so dont worry too much about that.



In DBD make sure you set the controller controls to the following:
* Run- LB
* Crouch- Right DPad
* Drop Item- B
* Use Item- Y
* Pickup Item/Interactions- X
* Actions- A
* Activate Ability- A
* Wiggle Right/Left- B


### How to Play DBD with a RingCon

* To Move- Run in place (you will always move in the direction you are facing)
* To Sprint- Hold down RB while moving
* To Crouch- Squat and hold Right Trigger (if you stop doing either you will no longer crouch)
* To work on Gens, Sabo, Totems, Chests, Hatch/Doors- Hold your Arms up and hold Y on the Right JoyCon
* To use Items- Hold Arms up and hold X with the Right Joycon
* To do Skill Checks- Squat (more of a half squat) while keeping your Arms up
* To do "Actions" (Vaulting, Lockers, Drop Pallet)- "Flick" RingCon forward (make it flat) while hitting B on the Right Joycon
* To Wiggle out of Killer's Grasp- Tap A on the Right Joycon (you can turn it into a "workout" by doing Hip Shakes if you want)

  

### FAQ

* Do you need the Titan Two to do this?
  - You may be able to set it up with the Cronus Zen (see SuperLois64's video on that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hKHsAgjag) But I havent tested that so I dont honestly know!

* Why do Skill Checks sometimes stop you from working on gens/healing??
  - I'll be honest, I'm not a programmer so the code isnt perfect. Th eonly thing I can think of is that it thinks you started to move and therefore kicks you off the gen.
  
* Why doesnt the code seem to work in game?
    - Make sure your controls are set up correctly in game (see "Setting up Controls" above)
    - Make sure the lights of the JoyCons are in the top spot otherwise the game will consider it as "player 2" and not work. 
    - You may have to resync the JoyCons and restart the game, make sure the JoyCons are vertical when syncing!
   
* I've reset the JoyCons and rebooted the game and it still doesn't work, what is wrong?
    - Shoot me a message on Twitter (https://twitter.com/ItsKaboose_ttv) and I can try to help you out.
    
* Why do you hate yourself?
    - I ask yself that every time I play this, I thought it would be a fun idea and now I'm trapped...
